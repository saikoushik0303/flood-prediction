# flood-prediction
This project aims at building predictive model based on the  historical weather data of particular areas in order to predict the occurrence of floods.
Conventional systems run a little low in
forecasting floods at the right time. By using machine learning we 
can predict floods or forecast floods with better accuracy.The 
predictive model is built on different machine learning algorithms. 
The concerned authority monitor this flood prediction system
through a web application.
